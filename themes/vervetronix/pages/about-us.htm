                                VerveTronix is more about simplicity, mass appeal, crowdsource, open hardware software platforms and lean profits instead of brand-legacy, proprietary technology, and premium price-tags. The result is that we are able to create products that either have no easy alternatives in the market or are priced much lower than any of the alternatives.

                                We are so obsessed by our quality and consumer experience that we retain maximum possible control of manufacturing right under our noses instead of blindly outsourcing it to outsourcing havens. Yeah, it's harder this way but we don't plan on shying away from hard things just because they're worth it.

                                            been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer. Mr. Fogg was, it is true, twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour.</p>

                                        <p>The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four
                                            hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific. He found himself, then, about twenty-four hours behind-hand.</p>
